Introduction to Programming
First things first: Learn vi editor to open a file, write a program, save the file.
### Compiling your first program
Compile the program - gcc and the default makefile.
### Executing your first program
Print Hello world on the console.
Print formatting: Understand new line character.
Preprocessor: Concept of #include.
Use of 'make' to build a program

## ch02 Input output
