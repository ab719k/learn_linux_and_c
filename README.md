Programming in C on Linux Operating System


## ch01 Introduction to C
Introduction to Programming "Hello World."<br/>
First things first: Learn vi editor to open a file, write a program, save the file.
Compiling your first program - gcc and the default makefile.<br/>
Executing your first program.<br/>
Print formatting: Understand new line character.<br/>
Preprocessor: Concept of #include.<br/>
Use of 'make' to build a program<br/>

## ch02 Input output
Standard I/O: Getc, putc,  Getchar, putchar<br/>
Formatted I/O Functions : Writing to output printf, Reading User Input scanf <br/>

## Character Set
Character Set Encoding <br/>
String Constants<br/>

## ch03 Types & Variable
Basic Types & variables: char, int, float, double <br/>
Preprocessor #define <br/>
Variables and associated memory <br/>
Print Formatting (contd) %c, %f, %d <br/>
Understand concept of memory as in how the variables are stored in memory <br/>
Assignments, Expressions <br/>

## ch04 Operators 
Addition, Subtraction, Division, Multiplications, Modulus (+, -, *, /, %) <br/>
Comparison Operator == <br/>
Logical Operations &&, ||<br/>
Unary operators *, & <br/>
Bitwise Operators &, |, ~, ^<br/>

## ch05 Control Statement
Decision/ Conditional
if statement, if else
Preprocessor directive #define, #ifdef, #if, #elif, #endif

### Loop
While(condition)  {Loop}
For(initial, condition, increment) {Loop}
Do {Loop} Until(condition)
Infinite loop While(1) {Loop, usually with a sleep unless busy waiting }
The break, continue statement
